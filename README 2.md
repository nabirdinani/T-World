To Team:

1. Use whatever IDE you want
2. Simply create a new web project in the IDE of your choice (NetBeans, IntelliJ, VS, WebMatrix, etc.)
3. Pull the most recent code from master to your project's HTML/JS root directory (master will contain root directory of website)
4. After coding, push everything in your local HTML/JS root to github (excluding your IDE's project template/manifest files).

- PLEASE IF PUSHING TO MASTER ALWAYS PULL FIRST SO YOU DON'T OVERWRITE EVERYTHING. 
- Otherwise, work as you please in your own section's branches.

We will do things this way so that you all may use the IDE of your choice and not worry about IDE manifests getting corrupt.
This way you can also code in other languages, taking advantage of features you are comfortable with, without being restricted to an IDE that may not cater to your needs.
